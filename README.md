## Welcome to laypsychohistory.com.

**What is lay psychohistory?** "Lay psychohistory" denotes a "psychohistory" described in everyday terms, at least for the purposes of this website.

Psychohistorians, to quote from the [International Psychohistorical Association](https://www.psychohistory.us/what-is-psychohistory.php), figure out the role that the "unconscious motivations of individuals and groups" play in history. If you lost me at "unconscious," do not worry; the [Introduction to Psychohistory]() section of this website-- which everyone is recommended to read-- presents a clearer and more detailed explanation of psychohistory.

The typical psychohistorical theory speaks about history and psychology in detail and complexity. Psychohistory is thus not accessible to those with little knowledge of history and/or psychology.

The aim of this website, in its broadest sense, is to make any aspect of psychohistory more accessible. To that end, several projects, each ranging in complexity and detail, are being maintained:
1. Introduction to Psychohistory
2. Lay Summaries
* academic paper #1
* academic paper #2

4. Detailed Summary #1: *White Racism*, by Dr. Joel Kovel (1974)
	* video series explaining each chapter
	* articles complementing each video
5. My Interpretations of our Current World
	* close readings of books, movies, TV shows, advertisements, etc
	* outlines for unfinished analyses
6. Catalog of Cultural Symbols
	* list of cultural symbols that are associated with orality, anality, and/and the oedipus complex
