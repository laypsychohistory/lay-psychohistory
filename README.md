**What is lay psychohistory?** "Lay psychohistory" denotes a "psychohistory" described in everyday terms, at least for the purposes of this website.

What is psychohistory? What do psychohistorians do? To quote from the [International Psychohistorical Association](https://www.psychohistory.us/what-is-psychohistory.php), psychohistorians figure out the role that the "unconscious motivations of individuals and groups" play in history. If you lost me at "unconscious," do not worry; the Introduction to Psychohistory section of this website-- which everyone is recommended to read-- presents a clearer and more detailed explanation of psychohistory.

The typical psychohistorical theory is detailed and complex in history and psychology, and thus psychohistory is not accessible to those with little knowledge of history and/or psychology.

This website aims to make psychohistory more accessible. To this end, two main aims are proposed. First, to present psychohistory in non-technical terms, allowing those with little knowledge of history or psychology to at least grasp the magnitude of connections between history and pscyhology, if not begin to understand some of the main psyco-cultural forces that drive history. The second aim is to present psychohistory in a more technical manner, allowing those who wish to understand the detail and complexity a view at the precise mechanisms tying together pscyhology, personality, history, and culture.

To these ends, several projects are maintained:
_alphabetical_
1. [Catalog of Cultural Symbols](laypsychohistory.com/cultural-symbols-table): table of cultural symbols (as defined in _White Racism: a Psychohistory_)
2. [Close Readings](laypsychohistory.com/close-readings): my psychohistorical analysis of contemporary culture.
3. [Detailed Summaries](laypsychohistory.com/detailed-summaries): technical summaries of journal articles and books on psychohistory.
4. [Introduction to Psychohistory](laypsychohistory.com/intro-psychohistory): what is psychohistory? Includes various definitions.
5. [Lay Summaries](laypsychohistory.com/lay-summaries): non-technical summaries of journal articles and books on psychohistory.
