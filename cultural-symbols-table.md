# Table of Cultural Symbols

Tables of cultural symbols that I have noticed. At the moment these are in alphabetical order. There is a "Category" column provided, so you can search with Ctrl-F by Category.

Major categories so far include:
* foods
* games
* corporeal
* technology
* money

If there is enough interest in this catalog of symbols, a top priority for a future website will be to convert this table into a searchable database with lots of additional functionality. If you'd like to discuss or add a symbol, try opening an issue or creating a pull request-- I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way to use github to make a suggestion, but those options should work for now.
